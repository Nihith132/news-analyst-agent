## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

This project follows a simple but powerful workflow:

1.  **Fetch:** The agent queries the NewsAPI for the top 5 most recent articles related to a specified topic (e.g., "advancements in generative AI").
2.  **Contextualize:** The titles and descriptions of these articles are compiled into a single context block.
3.  **Analyze:** This context is sent to an LLM (GPT-3.5-Turbo) with a carefully crafted prompt, instructing it to act as an analyst and provide a summary, market sentiment, and future implications.
4.  **Report:** The final analysis from the LLM is printed to the console.
